# 3DSystems-DeDRM

## Preface
  I created this project after finding a dirt cheap FabPro-1000 on Facebook. But as you may know if you are checking out this repository, it is ***FULL*** of DRM protections, covering everything from the slicer to the actual bottles of resin themselves. I get that these protections may be needed in an industrial setting, but I am just a hobbist printer that just wants to keep their printer running as long as they can push it. So being as stubborn as I am I decided to pick all of their attempts at obfuscating their software apart.
